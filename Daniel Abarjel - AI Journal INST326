Week 1:
This week, I used very little AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to remind me of the syntax for how to use strip() and how to use .find(). I learned the syntax for those through the  examples ChatGPT provided. I also asked ChatGPT if there was a better way to do print values without individually making f-strings for each value, but settled on just making individual f-strings anyway, because I didn't want to put all the values into a list like suggested. 

Here is the link to my week 1 chat: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c76159-30e0-8001-8475-8ca40acd2fba
