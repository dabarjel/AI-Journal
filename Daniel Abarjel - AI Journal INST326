Week 1:
This week, I used very little AI while working on the exercises. I asked ChatGPT to remind me of the syntax for how to use strip() and how to use .find(). I learned the syntax for those through the  examples ChatGPT provided. I also asked ChatGPT if there was a better way to do print values without individually making f-strings for each value, but settled on just making individual f-strings anyway, because I didn't want to put all the values into a list like suggested.

Week 2:
This week, I used some AI while working on the exercises. I used ChatGPT to discover and teach me about enumerating. "Enumerate" proved to be very useful and returns the index and the item, which skips calling the index separately, and is cleaner. I didn't really need AI for the rest of it.

Week 3: 
This week, I asked ChatGPT to teach me about .join(), which proved to be very useful for completing the weekly exercises.

Week 4:
This week, AI played a bigger role in helping me complete the assignment. For questions 10 and 13, I kept getting AssertionErrors no matter what I tried so I input my code, the test, and the error into ChatGPT in order to help me solve the errors. ChatGPT helped me add .strip to the end of my code for #13 and change the test for 10 because no matter what I did, it wouldn't pass due to the values provided in the test.

Week 5:
This week involved more AI use than previous weeks due to the function library project. For the function library project, ChatGPT was used to help debug some of our functions and ensure we were doing things in an optimal way. After writing the basis for the functions, we would often input them to ChatGPT and ask for suggestions and improvements. Many times, we didn't make any changes, but ChatGPT was helpful for fixing small problems and writing and adding comments to our code. I also used ChatGPT to help me format some files the right way and help me understand and use GitHub better, which proved to be very effective and useful.

Week 6:
This week involved a decent bit of AI help just as a reminder on some of the concepts we learned about, and to review some of my code segments. I think it proved to be very helpful this week, especially with concept review. AI isn't that good at generating code, but it's fairly strong at explaining nuances and catching problems in your code.

Week 7:
This week involved a good bit of AI usage. I used ChatGPT to review my code and ensure it was functioning properly. I used ChatGPT many times to help me fix errors that often were simple syntax errors or stuff that was just annoying to spot and I missed. I also used ChatGPT to help me clean up some of my code. I noticed that many times I was rewriting code instead of calling functions. I used AI to help me find where those situations possibly were, and asked it to suggest ways I could improve my code by reducing repetition. My end result was cleaner code, which didn't rewrite code and used my functions instead. I didn't really use ChatGPT to generate much code, more as an aid to spot and fix errors.
